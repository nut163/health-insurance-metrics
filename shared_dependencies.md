As the task is to create documentation, the shared dependencies between the files are mainly related to the structure and format of the documentation. Here are the shared dependencies:

1. **Markdown Syntax**: All files are written in Markdown (.md), so they share the common syntax of Markdown for formatting text, creating tables, adding links, etc.

2. **Documentation Structure**: All files follow a similar structure for consistency. This includes sections like Introduction, Definition, Importance, Calculation, and Interpretation.

3. **KPI Data Schema**: Each KPI file would need to follow a consistent data schema for describing the KPI. This could include fields like 'KPI Name', 'Definition', 'Formula', 'Importance', and 'Example'.

4. **Navigation Links**: Each file will contain links to navigate to the previous and next KPI in the documentation. These links will be consistent across all files.

5. **Common Terms**: There will be common terms and definitions used across all files. For example, terms related to health insurance, marketing, and performance metrics.

6. **Image References**: If there are diagrams or images used to explain the KPIs, the image file names and paths would be shared dependencies.

7. **Footer**: Each file will likely end with a common footer that includes contact information, copyright notice, etc.

Note: As this task is about creating documentation and not a web application, there are no shared dependencies related to exported variables, id names of DOM elements, message names, or function names.
