# Policy Cancellation Rate

## Definition

The Policy Cancellation Rate is a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) that measures the percentage of policies that were cancelled by the policyholder or the insurance company during a specific period.

## Importance

Understanding the Policy Cancellation Rate is crucial for a Health Insurance Marketing Organization as it can indicate customer dissatisfaction, issues with the policy, or competitive pressures. A high cancellation rate could be a sign of problems that need to be addressed.

## Calculation

The Policy Cancellation Rate is calculated by dividing the number of cancelled policies by the total number of active policies during the same period, and then multiplying the result by 100 to get a percentage.

```
Policy Cancellation Rate = (Number of Cancelled Policies / Total Number of Active Policies) * 100
```

## Interpretation

A low Policy Cancellation Rate is generally a positive sign, indicating that customers are satisfied with their policies and choose to keep them. A high cancellation rate, on the other hand, could indicate problems with customer satisfaction or policy design.
