# Claims Ratio

## Definition

The Claims Ratio is a key performance indicator that measures the total amount of claims paid out by an insurance company divided by the total amount of premiums earned. It is a critical measure of an insurance company's financial health.

## Importance

The Claims Ratio helps to understand how well the insurance company is managing its underwriting risks. A high claims ratio may indicate that the company is not pricing its products correctly or is not managing its risks well. On the other hand, a low claims ratio may indicate that the company is either pricing its products too high or not providing adequate coverage.

## Calculation

The Claims Ratio is calculated using the following formula:

```
Claims Ratio = (Total Claims Paid / Total Premiums Earned) * 100
```

## Interpretation

A lower claims ratio is generally better for the insurance company as it indicates that the company is retaining a larger portion of the premiums as profits. However, a very low claims ratio may also indicate that the company is not providing adequate coverage to its policyholders.
