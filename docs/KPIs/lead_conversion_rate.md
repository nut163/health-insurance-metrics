# Lead Conversion Rate

## Definition

The Lead Conversion Rate is a key performance indicator that measures the effectiveness of your marketing efforts in converting leads into paying customers. It is calculated by dividing the number of new customers by the number of leads, and multiplying the result by 100 to get a percentage.

## Importance

Understanding your Lead Conversion Rate can help you identify how well your sales and marketing strategies are working. A high conversion rate means your marketing efforts are successful in attracting potential customers and turning them into actual customers. Conversely, a low conversion rate may indicate that your marketing strategies need improvement.

## Calculation

The formula to calculate Lead Conversion Rate is:

```
Lead Conversion Rate = (Number of New Customers / Number of Leads) * 100
```

## Interpretation

A higher Lead Conversion Rate indicates a more effective marketing strategy. It means that a higher percentage of your leads are being converted into customers. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as effective sales techniques, attractive pricing, or a compelling product offering.
