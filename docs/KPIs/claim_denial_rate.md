# Claim Denial Rate

## Introduction

The Claim Denial Rate is a crucial KPI for any Health Insurance Marketing Organization. It measures the percentage of claims that were denied by the insurance company.

## Definition

Claim Denial Rate is calculated by dividing the number of denied claims by the total number of claims submitted.

## Importance

Understanding the Claim Denial Rate can help an organization identify issues in their claim processing and take corrective measures. A high Claim Denial Rate could indicate problems with the claim submission process, policyholder understanding of their coverage, or stringent claim approval criteria.

## Calculation

The formula to calculate Claim Denial Rate is:

```
Claim Denial Rate = (Number of Denied Claims / Total Number of Claims Submitted) * 100
```

## Interpretation

A lower Claim Denial Rate is generally better, as it indicates that a higher percentage of policyholders' claims are being approved. However, an extremely low Claim Denial Rate could also indicate that the organization is not adequately assessing risk and could be approving claims that should be denied.
