# Loss Ratio

## Definition

The Loss Ratio is a key performance indicator (KPI) that measures the ratio of claims paid out by an insurance company to the premiums earned. It is a critical measure of an insurance company's profitability and financial health.

## Importance

A high loss ratio may indicate that an insurance company is not pricing its policies correctly and may be facing financial trouble. On the other hand, a low loss ratio may suggest that the company is either pricing its policies too high or not paying out enough in claims.

## Calculation

The Loss Ratio is calculated using the following formula:

```
Loss Ratio = (Total Claims Paid + Adjustment Expenses) / Total Earned Premiums
```

## Interpretation

A loss ratio of 60% means that 60 cents of every premium dollar is being paid out in claims. The remaining 40 cents is used to cover the insurance company's operating expenses and profits.

## Example

If an insurance company has paid out $5 million in claims and has earned $10 million in premiums, the loss ratio would be 50%.
