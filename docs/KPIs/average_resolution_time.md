# Average Resolution Time

## Definition

Average Resolution Time is a key performance indicator (KPI) that measures the average time taken to resolve a claim or a customer issue. It is a critical metric for health insurance marketing organizations as it directly impacts customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

## Importance

- **Customer Satisfaction**: A lower average resolution time indicates that the organization is able to resolve claims or issues quickly, leading to higher customer satisfaction.
- **Operational Efficiency**: This KPI also reflects the efficiency of the organization's claim processing and customer service departments.

## Calculation

Average Resolution Time is calculated by dividing the total time taken to resolve all claims or issues by the total number of claims or issues resolved in a given period.

```
Average Resolution Time = Total Resolution Time / Total Number of Resolved Claims or Issues
```

## Interpretation

A lower Average Resolution Time is generally better, as it indicates that the organization is able to resolve claims or issues quickly. However, it's also important to ensure that the quality of resolution is not compromised in the process.
