# Customer Acquisition Cost

## Definition

Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) is a key performance indicator (KPI) that measures the cost associated with acquiring a new customer. In the context of a Health Insurance Marketing Organization, it includes the cost of marketing and sales efforts.

## Importance

Understanding the CAC helps the organization to determine how much value each new customer needs to bring to cover the cost of acquiring them. It is crucial for budgeting, financial forecasting, and evaluating the effectiveness of marketing strategies.

## Calculation

The formula to calculate CAC is:

```
CAC = Total Marketing and Sales Cost / Number of New Customers Acquired
```

## Interpretation

A lower CAC is generally better, as it means the organization is acquiring customers more efficiently. However, it's important to balance CAC with the value each customer brings (Customer Lifetime Value or CLV). If the CAC is higher than the CLV, the organization may be losing money on its customer acquisition efforts.

## Example

If a Health Insurance Marketing Organization spent $100,000 on marketing and sales in a month and acquired 1000 new customers, the CAC would be $100.
