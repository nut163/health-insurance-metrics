# Total Sales

## Definition

Total Sales is a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) that measures the total revenue generated from all the policies sold by the health insurance marketing organization.

## Importance

Total Sales is a fundamental KPI for any sales organization. It provides a clear measure of the organization's overall sales performance and is a key indicator of the organization's financial health.

## Calculation

Total Sales is calculated by summing up the premium of all the policies sold within a specific period.

```
Total Sales = Sum of premiums of all policies sold
```

## Interpretation

A high Total Sales value indicates a high volume of policies sold and a strong sales performance. However, it's important to also consider other KPIs like Average Premium and Policy Renewal Rate to get a more comprehensive view of the organization's performance.
