# Net Promoter Score (NPS)

## Definition

The Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a measure of customer loyalty and satisfaction. It is calculated by asking customers a single question: "On a scale of 0-10, how likely are you to recommend our company to a friend or colleague?" 

## Importance

NPS is a key performance indicator for health insurance marketing organizations as it provides a clear measure of overall customer satisfaction and loyalty, which are critical for customer retention and growth.

## Calculation

The NPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of customers who are Detractors (those who give a score of 0-6) from the percentage of customers who are Promoters (those who give a score of 9-10).

```
NPS = % Promoters - % Detractors
```

## Interpretation

A positive NPS (i.e., greater than zero) is generally considered good, and a score of 50 or above is considered excellent. However, the goal should always be to improve NPS over time, as this indicates increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## Example

If a health insurance marketing organization surveyed 100 customers and found that 60 were Promoters, 30 were Passives (score of 7-8), and 10 were Detractors, the NPS would be:

```
NPS = 60% - 10% = 50
```

This would be considered an excellent NPS.
