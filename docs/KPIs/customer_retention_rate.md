# Customer Retention Rate

## Definition

Customer Retention Rate (CRR) is a key performance indicator (KPI) that measures the percentage of customers a company retains over a given period. It's a crucial metric for health insurance marketing organizations as it indicates the effectiveness of customer satisfaction and loyalty programs.

## Importance

A high CRR indicates that customers are satisfied with the insurance policies and services provided, leading to higher customer loyalty and potentially more referrals. It also helps in understanding the effectiveness of the customer service and the overall customer experience provided by the organization.

## Calculation

The formula to calculate Customer Retention Rate is:

```
CRR = ((E-N)/S) * 100
```

Where:
- E is the number of customers at the end of the period
- N is the number of new customers acquired during the period
- S is the number of customers at the start of the period

## Interpretation

A high CRR is a good sign as it means that the organization is able to retain its customers effectively. On the other hand, a low CRR could indicate problems with customer satisfaction, policy terms, or customer service.
