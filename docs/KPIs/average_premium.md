# Average Premium

## Definition

The Average Premium is a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) that measures the average amount of money your health insurance agency collects from a policyholder for a defined period.

## Importance

Understanding the Average Premium helps in forecasting revenue and making strategic decisions about pricing, underwriting, and profitability.

## Calculation

The Average Premium is calculated by dividing the total premium collected by the number of policies sold.

```
Average Premium = Total Premium Collected / Number of Policies Sold
```

## Interpretation

A higher Average Premium might indicate that your agency is selling more high-value policies, which could lead to higher profitability. However, it's important to balance this with the risk profile of your policyholders.
