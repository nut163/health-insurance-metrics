# Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

## Definition

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a prediction of the net profit attributed to the entire future relationship with a customer. In the context of a Health Insurance Marketing Organization, it represents the total revenue the organization can reasonably expect from a single customer account.

## Importance

Understanding the CLV helps the organization in making decisions about how much money to invest in acquiring new customers and retaining existing ones. By focusing on increasing the CLV, companies can enhance the return on their marketing investments.

## Calculation

The CLV can be calculated using the following formula:

```
CLV = (Average Premium per Policy * Retention Rate) / (1 + Discount Rate - Retention Rate) - Acquisition Cost
```

- **Average Premium per Policy**: The average amount of money made from a policy in a given period.
- **Retention Rate**: The percentage of customers that continue to renew their policy.
- **Discount Rate**: The organization's cost of capital.
- **Acquisition Cost**: The cost of acquiring a new customer.

## Interpretation

A higher CLV implies that customers are more valuable to the organization, which could be due to higher premiums, higher retention rates, or lower acquisition costs. On the other hand, a lower CLV could indicate issues with customer retention or high acquisition costs.
